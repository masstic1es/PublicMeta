Meta modules I've created to be used by anyone
<br>
More info in the [Public Meta Wiki](https://github.com/masstic1es/PublicMeta/wiki)

A huge thanks to Harli, Sunuj, and the amazing Virindi for providing us with the tools to make these Metas and customize our gameplay.
<br>
* Get the lastest release of MiMB [here](https://github.com/harliq/MetaBuilder/releases/tag/v2.1.0.0)
* Get the latest release of UtilityBelt [here](http://utilitybelt.ga/master/)
* Get Virindi Tank [here](http://www.virindi.net/plugins/)
     
These metas all require UtilityBelt to function properly, and you will need to enable to expression engine with `/ub opt set VTank.PatchExpressionEngine true`
